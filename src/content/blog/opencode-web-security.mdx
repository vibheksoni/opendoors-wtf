## The Better Alternative?

I've been using **OpenCode** recently, and honestly, it feels like a superior alternative to Claude Code in many ways. It supports multiple LLM providers (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), it's open-source, and it feels faster. The flexibility to swap models on the fly makes it a powerhouse for local development.

However, like many developer tools in this space, it includes a "Web UI" mode (`opencode web`) that transforms your CLI into a browser-based application. This is great for usability, but it opens a massive security hole if you aren't careful.

## The Risk

When you run `opencode web`, it spins up a server. If you bind this to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) to access it from another device on your network, you are potentially exposing a **remote code execution (RCE)** vulnerability to the entire internet.

Just like the Claude Code Web UI I wrote about previously, OpenCode's web interface allows the user to run commands, edit files, and interact with the shell. Without authentication, anyone who finds your IP address becomes the admin of your machine.

## The Exposure (FOFA Search)

I ran a quick check on **FOFA** to see if this was happening in the wild.
Search query: `title="OpenCode"`

<Image src={step1Img} alt="FOFA.info search query for OpenCode instances" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid var(--border-subtle); margin: 2rem 0;" />

I found **32 exposed hosts** immediately.

<Image src={step2Img} alt="FOFA results showing 32 exposed OpenCode web instances" style="border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid var(--border-subtle); margin: 2rem 0;" />

While 32 might sound low, remember that this is a niche developer tool. That's 32 developers who have likely accidentally exposed their entire development environment to the public web. Since OpenCode is customizable, many users might be running modified versions that don't show up in this simple title search, meaning the real number is likely higher.

## How to Secure It

The developers of OpenCode have actually included a security mechanism, but you have to use it.

### 1. Set a Password
You can lock down the web UI by setting a password. This simple step prevents unauthorized access.

Run this command before starting the web server:
```bash
opencode --set-password <your-strong-password>
```
*Alternatively, you can set the `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` environment variable.*

### 2. Don't Expose to the Internet
Unless you have a very specific reason (and a VPN/Tunnel), do not forward the OpenCode port to the public internet. Keep it on `localhost` (`127.0.0.1`) or strictly within your trusted local network (`LAN`).

## Conclusion

OpenCode is an amazing tool that I highly recommend for its multi-model support and speed. But "powerful" means "dangerous" if you strip away the safeguards.

Don't let your coding assistant become an attacker's entry point. Set a password.
