## The Concept

What if an attacker could replace a target's Chrome browser binary with a malicious version that launches a Chrome instance controlled by an external program? This would give an attacker complete control over the user's browsing activity while maintaining the appearance of a normal browser.

## Technical Implementation

The PoC leverages several key components:

### Binary Replacement

- Replaces the legitimate Chrome binary with a modified version
- Maintains all original Chrome functionality
- Seamlessly integrates with the system

### Profile Loading

- Loads the user's existing Chrome profile
- Maintains access to saved passwords, bookmarks, and history
- Creates a completely authentic browsing environment

### Browser Control

- Uses Selenium for browser automation
- Implements real-time monitoring of all browser activities
- Captures form submissions, cookies, and session data

### Stealth Operations

- Integrates the undetected-chromedriver library
- Bypasses common browser automation detection systems
- Appears as a legitimate browser instance

## Security Implications

This research exposes several critical security concerns:

### Profile Access

- Complete access to saved credentials
- Access to authentication tokens and cookies
- Ability to hijack existing sessions

### Data Interception

- Real-time monitoring of form submissions
- Capture of sensitive input data
- Interception of authentication flows

### Session Control

- Ability to maintain persistent access
- Manipulation of active sessions
- Cross-origin request capabilities

## Mitigation Strategies

To protect against such attacks, organizations and users should:

- Implement strict binary verification
- Use hardware security modules where possible
- Monitor for unauthorized binary modifications
- Implement application allowlisting
- Conduct regular security audits of installed applications

## Credits

This research uses the [undetected-chromedriver](https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/undetected-chromedriver) library.
